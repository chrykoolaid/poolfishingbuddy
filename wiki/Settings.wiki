*Mount:* This combobox is generated on loading the form and will show up the mounts your char knows.

*Ninja Pools:* If checked, your char will also fish from pools if already other players are nearby.

*Custom Cast Range:* This is the range (pool to char) the bot is looking for points to descend. If the bot is skipping to many pools because it couldn't find suitable points, try to set a higher value here.

*Max. tries of cast fishing:* If the bot fails to cast (sitting in lava, not in line of sight or whatnot) this is the value which defines the maximum tries before moving to another point.

*Use Lure:* If activated you can use luring. If you choose the "Weather-Beaten Fishing Hat", equip it or luring will be disabled again after the first attempt to use the hat! Like iwin on buddyforums said, there's no need to lure for poolfishing. With patch 3.3, you will never catch junk items from pools.

<td valign="top" align="left">
*Descend on higher reaches:* By default this is disabled, so the bot will descend on lower reaches first. If your char ends up in swimming very often you might want to check this.

*Max. of tries to descend:* A counter for pathing to the pool. If the counter runs to the limit, the will try to path to another point.

*Blacklist Schools:* If checked, you can choose regions (only Cataclysm yet) from combobox. For each region there will appear a list with checkboxes for each school. Just check the schools you want to blacklist.
