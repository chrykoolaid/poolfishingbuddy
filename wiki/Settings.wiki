*Mount:* This combobox is generated on loading the form and will show up the mounts your char knows.

*Fishing Pole and Weapons:* Click refresh and select the fishing pole and weapons the bot should use.

*Mode:* Bounce mode means that the bot will reverse your waypoints when the end of the route is reached. Circle mode means that the bot will continue with the first waypoint when the last of the route is reached.

*Height Modifier:* If you want the bot to fly higher, increase the height of the waypoints (z-coords) here.

*Auto. Training:* If checked, the bot will train automatically. Trainers are hardcoded and there's no need to add them to profiles or somewhere else.

*Hearth and Exit:* When checked, the bot will use heathstone if it isn't on cooldown and quit wow.

*Mail to:* When checked, the bot will mail all tradegoods of the subclass 8 and 10. That means all fish and volatiles, eternals etc. *You don't need a forcemail file!*

*Ninja Pools:* If checked, the bot will ignore other players and fish from same pools.

*Use Water Walking:* If checked there are two options. Racial water walking works for priests, shamans and deathknights. If you check potions, the bot will use "Elixir of Water Walking".

*Min. range to fish from:* This is the minimum range (pool to char) the bot is looking for points to descend. 

*Max. range to fish from:* This is the maximum range (pool to char) the bot is looking for points to descend. If the bot is skipping to many pools because it couldn't find suitable points, try to set a higher value here.

*Max. attempts to cast fishing:* If the bot fails to cast (because of sitting in lava, not in line of sight or whatnot) this is the value which defines the maximum tries before moving to another location near the pool.

*Max. attempts to reach Pool:* If the bot moves to another location (beacause of sitting in lava, not in line of sight or whatnot) this is the value which defines the maximum tries before blacklisting the pool for 2 minutes.
