<br>
<b>Height Modifier:</b> If you want the bot to fly higher, increase the height of the waypoints (z-coords) here.<br>

<b>Ninja Pools:</b> If checked, the bot will ignore other players and fish from same pools.<br>
<br>
<b>Use Water Walking:</b> If checked there are two options. Racial water walking works for priests, shamans and deathknights. If you check potions, the bot will use "Elixir of Water Walking".<br>
<br>
<b>Min. range to fish from:</b> This is the minimum range (pool to char) the bot is looking for points to descend.<br>
<br>
<b>Max. range to fish from:</b> This is the maximum range (pool to char) the bot is looking for points to descend. If the bot is skipping to many pools because it couldn't find suitable points, try to set a higher value here.<br>
<br>
<b>Max. attempts to cast fishing:</b> If the bot fails to cast (because of sitting in lava, not in line of sight or whatnot) this is the value which defines the maximum tries before moving to another location near the pool.<br>
<br>
<b>Max. attempts to reach Pool:</b> If the bot moves to another location (beacause of sitting in lava, not in line of sight or whatnot) this is the value which defines the maximum tries before blacklisting the pool for 2 minutes.<br>
